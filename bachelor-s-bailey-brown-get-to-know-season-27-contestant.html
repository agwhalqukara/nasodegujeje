She told <a href=#>the California native</a> to remember the quote “on the daily, I’ll be thinking of Bailey,” but when <a href=#>the former Bachelorette contestant</a> addressed her later in the evening, he called her “Bailen.” Bailey, however, wasn’t alone as Zach forgot nearly all of the ladies’ names moments after their first encounters.</p><p>While Bailey didn’t receive <a href=#>America’s first impression rose</a> vote — <a href=#><strong>Brianna Thorbourne</strong></a> was saved by the audience ahead of the season premiere — <a href=#>she did get a little leg up on the rest of the women</a>.</p><p>“Everyone impressed me.

Bailey is “truly ready to settle down” but isn’t on any dating apps, because she claimed she’s “<a href=#>not looking to date around</a>.”</p><p>The new TV personality hopes to “one day own her own business in the wellness world,” per her bio, as she is “passionate” about that industry.</p><p>“She loves traveling and going on an adventure and hopes <a href=#>Zach is also looking for an adventure buddy</a>,” the bio reads. “Bailey is extremely down to earth, gets along with everyone, and hopes her future husband will bring a similar energy to their relationship.”</p><p>In early January, Bailey shared her official press photo from the season via social media — teasing her excitement over the process.</p><p>“It’s like senior year photos … except this time I’m 27 and looking for love on national television 🌹,” <a href=#>she joked in the caption</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Bachelor season 27 premieres on ABC Monday, January 23, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Bailey:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXrqS0xKWmq6tdl66quMSyZJuqn6y7brPErWStp12gu7DDjKycmqufo3pzg4ycpqeslajBorrTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

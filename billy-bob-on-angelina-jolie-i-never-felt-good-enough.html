He is also father to Amanda, 37, William, 23 and Harry, 22, from previous relationships.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/51ecd3742183-kiss-z.jpg><p id=eNvhcfGJNewA data-wc=34>Angelina married actor <a class=hm-link href=#>Brad Pitt</a> in August 2014.

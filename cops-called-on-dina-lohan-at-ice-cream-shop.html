While checking out, Lindsay's mom produced a Carvel &#34;Black&#34; card, which entitles her to free ice cream for 75 years, she tells RadarOnline.com, which first reported the story.

Dina says. "Next minute, he grabbed my arm and took my card and held it hostage and wouldn't give me the cake! This guy was crazy!"</p><p>The problem: Everyone in the family has their own card, and Dina had accidentally grabbed 16-year-old daughter Ali's from the house before leaving the house.</p><p>PHOTOS: See Lindsay partying in Cannes just days before court</p><p>"I didn't think it be a problem," Dina told RadarOnline.com. "I couldn't believe this guy… it's a family card, it just didn't have my name on it."</p><p>"Next minute, four cop cars showed up, there's a police helicopter overhead and this guy makes it seem to the cops that I'm trying to use a stolen credit card — and for what?

"When Ali gets back, I'm going to bring her in everyday to this store — and you can print that!"</p><p>The company slams Dina in a new statement, saying Lindsay was just one of 75 celebs who received the promotional "Black" card to commemorate the ice cream shop's 75th birthday.</p><p>In a statement to <a href=#>RadarOnline.com</a>, they say, "Unfortunately, the Lohan family has been abusing the card. While the card was issued in Lindsay’s name only, her extended family has repeatedly used the card without her present. At first, we graciously honored their requests while explaining that the Black Card was not a carte blanc for unlimited Carvel Ice Cream for the extended Lohan family and friends. After more than six months of numerous and large orders for ice cream, we finally had to cut off the card and take it back."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacp6CoeqSty6WcnWWfo3qltc2aZKWnmJa7bq3TZqCcnV2Yv6atzGaqoaegYn9xfY9qbm9n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The actress, 38, stepped out for the first time with new love <strong>Jose "Pepe" Antonio Baston</strong> at the Museo Jumex Opening dinner in Mexico City on Friday, Nov. 15 with the handsome, 45-year-old businessman. A source confirms to&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>, "They have been seeing each other for a few weeks. He's super sweet to her and a complete gentleman."</p><p>The Desperate Housewives star beamed for the camera in a classy, form-fitting, sleeved, black-and-white body-con dress. She completed her sophisticated ensemble with pointed stiletto pumps and a black, satin clutch with gold hardware.&nbsp;</p><p>Baston, meanwhile, is a worthy match for the Devious Maids producer: The business executive is president of Televisa, Latin America's largest media company, and the world's largest Spanish-speaking media conglomerate, according to his official biography page for the company.</p><p>Longoria and her new love were first spotted kissing and holding hands in NYC in late October. The source adds to <strong>Us</strong>, "They have been spending a lot of time together and like each other a lot."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Prior to dating Baston, she was linked to Miami-based entrepreneur <strong>Ernesto Arguello</strong> — who was ironically selected as a bachelor contestant on Longoria's reality TV series, Ready for Love. The two called it quits in August after four months of dating, as first reported by <strong>Us</strong>. "It wasn't that serious," a source told <strong>Us</strong> of Longoria's relationship with the contestant. "He was fun."</p><p>Prior to Arguello, Longoria dated NFL quarterback <strong>Mark Sanchez</strong> and <strong><a href=#>Penelope Cruz</a></strong>'s brother <strong>Eduardo Cruz</strong>. The beautiful star dated Cruz on-and-off-again for about one year, after they first got together in February 2011 — several months after the actress signed off on her divorce from NBA player <strong><a href=#>Tony Parker</a></strong>, her husband of 4 years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJyvmV2hvK%2BzzqugmmWUlsGqusZmma6rmaOytL%2FMmqVmop%2Bosm6tza2mp6GfYq%2Biv9OopWarlZp6tbTEoqlmnpmnwLV5z6Kara2imnq1u8aeq6GdomJ%2FcX2Sam9qaQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

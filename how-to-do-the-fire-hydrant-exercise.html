Otherwise you risk flailing your leg about for no real purpose—and without getting real results.</p><h3>Avoid leaning away from the lifted leg</h3><p>When you lift your leg, you want the rest of your body to stay in that hands-and-knees position, without shifting your weight and body.</p><p>“Because there is a lot of balance involved in a fire hydrant, clients naturally lean away from the lifted leg,” Roup says. “Think about plugging equally into both hands. This may mean your leg’s range of motion will be smaller, but you'll also notice your core even more.”</p><h3>Keep a neutral spine</h3><p>Once again, it's all about engaging that core. Rather than feeling yourself slip into an arched back, keep your spine in line with your head and hips.</p><h3>Don’t forget about your upper body</h3><p>The front part of your tripod may not be actively lifting during a fire hydrant, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t working.</p><p>“Think about staying active in your upper body, pressing through the floor and out of your shoulders,” Roup says.</p><h3>Consider adding a resistance band</h3><p>If you want to up the intensity of your fire hydrant, you can place a&nbsp;<a href=# referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/resistance-bands-accessories/>resistance band</a>&nbsp;around your thighs above your knees, so when you lift your leg, it’s also working to pull that band apart. Just remember to keep all the above tips in mind so you’re not compensating for this added challenge with incorrect form.</p><p>Now you’re ready to make like Fido and get lifting. You may not feel the same relief as your dog does, but you’ll certainly feel the burn!</p><p>Want to work on your fire hydrant base?

In 2018, she ended up taking home the trophy for storyteller at the Streamy Awards.</p><p>Gabbi began posting her sketches to Vine the following year (2013). Her viewership had skyrocketed to an incredible five million between the years 2013 and 2016, and it was these individuals who decided to become her followers. She achieved even more tremendous popularity with her storytime videos after she had set up her YouTube account. As of 2022, Hanna has more than five million followers on her channel and more than a billion views.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.celebseek.com/uploads//2022/8/fee58fd1-181d-4bd3-bbb8-6cfa100380e8.webp><p>In 2015, Gabbi was cast in the role of Gabbi in the television series “Dance Showdown,” which was her first professional acting role. She made appearances in the short film “Occupy Alice” and the television miniseries “Oscar’s Hotel for Fantastical Creatures” in the same year, in addition to making a guest appearance in the series “Sanders Shorts.” Both of these roles were in the same year. She performed in the television series “David’s Vlog” from 2015 to 2016 and then went on to act in “Laid in America,” “Betch,” and several video shorts. In 2019, she was given a regular part in the television series “Escape the Night.” Hanna finally achieved her lifelong ambition of becoming an actor. She has done very well in securing a range of guest roles, including a recurring character, on many different television shows.</p><p>It would appear that Gabbi Hanna’s ability knows no bounds. She is incredibly talented. She is an author who is well regarded and has a collection of her poems published in a book. Additionally, she has published an album with the title “This Time Next Year” through an independent label and made it available for digital download. Additionally, Hanna has released eight singles between 2017 and the present.

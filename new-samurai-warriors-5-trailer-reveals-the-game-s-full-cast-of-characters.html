The newly released trailer is a retrospect on the story, interwoven with the character’s introduction, featuring all of the old franchise’s characters and four recently added figures."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The newly released trailer is a retrospect on the story, interwoven with the character’s introduction, featuring all of the old franchise’s <a href=#>characters</a> and four recently added figures. You can watch the trailer below.</p><p>The new Samurai Warriors 5 Character trailer displays the full cast of characters involved in the story, as well as four combatants <a href=#>Koei Tecmo</a> added to the story: head of the Iga ninja clan Sandayū Momochi, the legendary katana master Hattori Hanzō, a sword-for-hire Magoichi Saika, And Nobunaga’s “consultant” Yasuke. With the new figures, the total number of playable characters now totals at 27, all of which are displayed in the Character Trailer. However, the trailer also introduces older versions of Nobunaga Oda and Mitsuhide Akechi, both of which will be playable.</p><p>You can watch the Samurai Warriors 5 trailer right here:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The total character cast has been significantly reduced when compared to the previous game. The 2014’s <a href=#>Samurai Warriors 4</a> featured 55 playable characters, which is more than double the number presented in the new game. Still, this isn’t as shocking as newcomers to the franchise believe, since Samurai Warriors 5 serves as a series’ reboot and a fresh re-imagining, with the all-new storyline, redesigned characters, and enhanced graphics.</p><p>Samurai Warriors 5‘s main story is heavily inspired by the original game’s story, with Nobunaga and Mitsuhide as the primary focus. However, there are several differences between the two stories, and the story of the new game ends with the <a href=#>Honnō-Ji Incident</a> (death of Nobunaga). The reigning periods of Toyotomi and Tokugawa clans covered by the original story are now excluded from the re-telling.</p><p>Besides story touchups and character redesign, most of the characters’ movesets and gameplay have changed. The new Samurai Warriors 5 will allow players to wield different weapons or even swap them during battle like the series’ fans witnessed in <a href=#>Dynasty Warriors 7</a>. With everything redesigned, it’s important to stress out that the game’s core hasn’t changed. Samurai Warriors 5 will remain a <a href=#>hack-and-slash</a> game in which the players face hundreds of enemies on the battlefield, with the usual objective of defeating the enemy commander.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/samurai-warriors-5-1-900x506.jpg><p>Announced on February 17, 2021, Samurai Warriors 5 is a part of a long-running Warriors series of hack-and-slash video games published under the same developer. The Samurai Warriors is actually a sister series of the Dynasty Warriors series, a spin-off of Koei’s Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, based on Chinese historical texts. The first game of the Samurai Warriors series was released in 2004 and sold over one million copies in Japan alone. Its massive success led to numerous sequels, selling over 7 million units worldwide as of January 2021.</p><p>The newest addition to the series, Samurai Warriors 5, is due to release on July 27 for <a href=#>Nintendo Switch</a>, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam. The console version of the game will be playable on next-gen consoles through backward compatibility.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8aapJ6rX6iursHRmqBmr5Gnv6q70axkbmWkp66quMSrZaGsnaE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

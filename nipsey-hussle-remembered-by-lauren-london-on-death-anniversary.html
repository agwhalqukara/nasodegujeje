Our body is like the cage, and the spirit is like the bird.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>London continued: “We see that without the cage this bird flies in the world of sleep; therefore, if the cage becomes broken, the bird will continue and exist. Its feelings will be even more powerful, its perceptions greater, and its happiness increased.</p><p>“In truth, from hell it reaches a paradise of delights because for the thankful birds there is no paradise greater than freedom.'”</p><p>London’s comments section was flooded with messages of empathy and support from <a href=# rel=noopener>Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>YG</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Pusha T</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Questlove,</a> LaLa Anthony, Nia Long, Ella Mai and more.</p><p>Nipsey Hussle’s killer, Eric Holder Jr., was <a class=underline-link href=#>sentenced to 60 years to life in prison by a Los Angeles judge</a> in February, eight months after being convicted for gunning down the rapper.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Holder, 33, was allegedly angered by Nipsey accusing him of being a snitch during a brief conversation outside his South L.A. clothing store.

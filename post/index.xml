地元の滋賀を活発化されていますが、
そこには意外な理由があったそうです。
滋賀生まれの滋賀育ちである西川貴教さんですが、
地元の愛の強い方として、
滋賀県でも愛されてました。
それでも、実は故郷の母が心配で、
実家に里帰りする意味もあったそうです。
Ｔ．Ｍ．Ｒｅｖｏｌｕｔｉｏｎこと歌手の西川貴教（４６）の実母・一子（かずこ）さんが２９日に亡くなっていたことが３０日、分かった。６９歳だった。死因は遺族の意向で明らかになっていないが、５年以上前から闘病生活を送っていた。引用元：https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20170831-00000001-dal-ent
しかし、ずっと大切にしてきた、
お母さんが、先日、亡くなってしまったそうです。
ここ数年間、病気のお母さんのために、
定期的に里帰りや、滋賀関連の仕事を続けてしました。
お母さんが亡くなった今、
とても辛い心境に陥ってることでしょう。
西川貴教の母が死去(名前・一子) 西川貴教さんの母が亡くなったのは、
２９日未明だったそうですが、
西川貴教さんは東京で仕事があり、
母の最後を看取ることができなかったそうです。
今月８月の３０日にお通夜が営まれたそうですが、
長男である西川貴教さん自身が、
喪主を務め、気丈に弔問客たちに答えたそうです。
どこまでも立派な方でかっこいいです・・・。
関係者によると、２９日未明に一子さんが息を引き取った際、西川は東京におり、最期をみとることはできなかったという。３０日には滋賀県内で親族と親しい関係者のみで通夜が営まれた。長男の西川は喪主を務め、気丈に弔問客に対応した。引用元：https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20170831-00000001-dal-ent
６９歳で亡くなるのは、
少し早いはずですが、
西川貴教さんは十分に親孝行したことでしょう。
父は地方公務員で、母は市民病院に勤めていましたが、
西川貴教さんの律儀で礼儀正しい一面は、
きっと、両親の良い影響を受けてのことだったでしょう。
この先の西川貴教さんのコメントなども気になります。
西川貴教の母の闘病生活と死因と病名。兄弟とコメント 過去には西川貴教さんは、
自身のツイッターの中で、
お母さんが大きな手術を受けていたことを明らかにしてました。
ファンからもお母さんが闘病生活をしてることは有名で、
ライブでのMCでは家族の話になると、
少し感傷的な空気が流れていたそうです。
西川は、母の闘病を支えるため、大阪での仕事の際には必ず滋賀の実家に帰省していた。１２年６月にはツイッターに、「母の手術にたちあっていました。数年前に見付かった髄膜の腫瘍を切除する８時間の大きな手術でした」とつづり、腫瘍が良性だったことも報告していた。
２７日放送のフジテレビ系「ボクらの時代」では、０９年から滋賀で主宰している音楽イベント「イナズマロックフェス」について、「観光大使になったのが（開催の）きっかけっていうのもあるんですけど、本当の本当はオフクロが病気してから帰る理由を作るのに、仕事を作ったんです」と告白。「（フェスが）１０周年になったら言おうと思っていた」「かあちゃんの病気と共に、年が重なってる」と母への思いを明かしていた。引用元：https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20170831-00000001-dal-ent
最近放送された「ボクらの時代」でも、
イナズマロックとともに歳を重ねた母を気遣い、
ファンや視聴者を感動させていました。
やはり、親孝行なミュージシャンというのは素敵ですね・・・。
西川貴教さんには妹が二人いますが、
長男が頑張ってくれたおかげて、
最後まで幸せな一家であったことでしょう。
今後、西川貴教さんは亡くなった母に向けて、
何かコメントを出したり、ライブで言及するかもしれません。
気丈に振る舞うと思いますが、
何か、涙が溢れそうです。
きっと、新アルバムを出せば、
そこには長くお世話になった母への想いがねじ込まれることでしょう。

"I first set eyes on Gill, a floor assistant at [a TV studio] in Leeds, when she was sent to meet me in the studio car park," he told the Guardian. "She was 20 years younger, we were living in different parts of the country… Yet work kept bringing us together and fondness turned to love. Our daughter, Sophie Mae, was born in March 2001.

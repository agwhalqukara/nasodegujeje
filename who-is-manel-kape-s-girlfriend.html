He had previously held the Rizin and Knock Out Championship bantamweight titles.</p><p dir=ltr>Kape's first MMA fight occurred when he was 14 years old. He faced Artur Gomes in his first professional bout at the age of 17 while competing with the Cage Fighters at Cage Fighters 2. Kape was victorious in the first round with a TKO.</p><p dir=ltr>Kape took a two-year sabbatical from boxing due to the three postponed contests. He later joined the Rizin Fighting Federation and was set to compete in the Rizin bantamweight Grand Prix. When he took on Erson Yamamoto at Rizin 6, he made his debut.</p><p dir=ltr>Yamamoto was confused by Kape's stated comment during the fight that "[Your] mom just lost and [You] are next," given that Erson's mother had already lost earlier in the evening. Despite the fact that many observers thought the stoppage was premature, Kape went on to win the fight with a left-leg head kick KO after only 71 seconds.</p><p dir=ltr>On March 30, 2020, the Ultimate Fighting Championship announced that Kape had signed a four-fight contract with them, making him the first Portuguese-Angolan fighter to do so.</p><p dir=ltr>Kape was scheduled to make his UFC 252 debut on August 15, 2020, against Rogério Bontorin. Due to Bontorin's ankle injury, the fight was later called off.</p><p dir=ltr>Kape was scheduled to fight Deiveson Figueiredo on July 8, 2023, at UFC 290. Figueiredo withdrew from the fight owing to a lack of medical clearance.</p><p dir=ltr>Kape and Kai Kara-France were scheduled to fight on September 10, 2023, at UFC 293. Felipe dos Santos, a promotional newcomer, was brought in to replace Kara-France, who backed out of the bout in late August due to an injury.</p><h2 id=manel-kapes-girlfriend-0 dir=ltr>Who is Manel Kape’s girlfriend?</h2><p dir=ltr>Manel Kape is currently single. It is discovered that Kape has made no mention of his girlfriend anywhere. As no other information has been available, it is assumed that he is single. Additionally, there is no information available about any of his previous partners. Kape is currently focused on his career and thrives on it.</p><h2 id=manel-kapes-girlfriend-1 dir=ltr>Manel Kape’s Daughter</h2><p dir=ltr>Manel Kape shared a photo of himself in Las Vegas on March 3, 2022, celebrating his daughter Amy's first birthday. Given that Manel is very private about his personal life, that caught the interest of many of his followers.</p><p dir=ltr>Manel had solely shared images of himself fighting and traveling, but he's now uncharacteristically revealed a photo of his daughter. The mother of the child is still a mystery, though.</p><p dir=ltr>In a recent post on May 31, 2022, Manel wished his daughter a happy four months and wrote, "4 months, and I'm more and more in love with her. My daughter, my best friend, my peace, my tenderness."</p><p dir=ltr>In an earlier interview, Manel stated, "I'm a new father; she completes two months now. She's super happy; it's a blessing in my life. It's something I wanted so much, and she gives good energy. I focus on my kid and my training, of course."</p><p dir=ltr>Manel went on to say of his daughter, "My daughter is like me; she sleeps very well. She doesn't bother me; it's rather me who bothers her all the time. When she sleeps, I wake her up cause I want to play with her."</p><p dir=ltr>The fighter updates us on his adorable daughter and posts about her frequently. In the photos he uploads to Instagram, his daughter Amy always seems so cute. The tough guy seemed to be having a wonderful time with his daughter.</p><h2 id=manel-kapes-girlfriend-2 dir=ltr>Manel Kape, Tim Elliot’s Ex-wife Issue</h2><p dir=ltr>Gina Mazany, an MMA fighter for women, and Elliott dated for a while before announcing their engagement in early 2020. Elliott recently revealed on social media that his wife had been cheating on him after what seemed to be a happy marriage. After Elliott disclosed that his ex-wife had been having an affair with his closest friend, Manel Kape accused Tim Elliott of doing so in order to attract attention.</p><p dir=ltr>In addition, Elliott discovered that Kevin Croom, his best buddy and teammate, and Mazany's best man during their wedding, had been having an affair. Tim Elliott has received support from the MMA world in the weeks since he made his statement. Elliott, though, has also faced some criticism. Manel Kape, a fellow flyweight, criticized the 36-year-old on Twitter and claimed that he merely discussed his personal problems in order to attract attention.</p><p dir=ltr>"A real man doesn't bring problems from house to street," tweeted Kape. "Much less expose your ex-wife. By the way, what did he expect from a woman with an onlyf*ns account selling her naked photos. In fact, Tim already knew; he only brought it to the public for his own attention (9 million P)."</p><p dir=ltr>Tim Elliott claimed he was overwhelmed by the love of the MMA community. Before his fight with Allan Nascimento at UFC on ESPN 46, Elliott sat down with the media and stated that in addition to the support of the crowd, he had also gotten words of encouragement from other UFC fighters.</p><p dir=ltr>Sean Strickland and Chris Leben were two of the people he mentioned as having gotten in touch.</p><h2 id=manel-kapes-girlfriend-faq>FAQs</h2><h3 class=faq-question-element readability=-3>Q.
